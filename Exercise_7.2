#The solution for the problem 7.2:

fname = input("Enter file name: ")
fh = open(fname)
total = 0
count = 0
for line in fh:
    if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"):
        continue
    slic = line.find(" ")
    raw_num = line[slic:]
    num = float(raw_num)
    total = num + total
    count = count + 1
    
    #print(num)
print("Average spam confidence:",total/count)
